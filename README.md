# Snake Game
## Overview
This is my version of the popular snake game, extracted from my **#100 Days of Code** challenge. This was built using the **Python** programming language which is my choice of language for the duration of this current challenge.<br>
The game is only just in its first stage, future updates would contain different difficulties and some additional features.
## How To Use
* Clone the repository to your local system
* Install ***python*** on your local system if not already installed.
* Run the __main.py__ file on your local terminal.
* Play the game using the direction buttons on yor keyboard.
